Ethereum: Token Minting and Burning Mechanism

The MyToken project is a simple smart contract written in Solidity that allows the creation, minting, and burning of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract defines a token called METAES with the abbreviation MTAES. It implements fundamental token functionalities such as minting new tokens to increase supply and burning tokens to reduce supply. These actions directly affect the balances of users who hold the tokens. The project demonstrates how to implement a basic token system and can serve as a foundation for more complex cryptocurrency or token-based applications.

Public Variables:

tokenName: Stores the name of the token, which is "METAES".
tokenAbbrv: Stores the abbreviation of the token, which is "MTAES".
totalSupply: Tracks the total number of tokens in circulation.
Balances Mapping:

A mapping is used to store the balance of each address holding the token. This means that for each Ethereum address, you can see how many tokens that address owns. The format is mapping(address => uint) public balances, where each address maps to a uint representing the balance.
Core Functionalities:
Mint Function:
The mint function allows new tokens to be created and added to the total supply. It takes two parameters:
_address: The address to which the newly minted tokens will be assigned.
_value: The number of tokens to mint.
The function works by increasing the totalSupply by the _value and adding the same _value to the balance of _address.

Burn Function:
The burn function allows tokens to be destroyed, reducing the total supply and the balance of a specified address. It takes two parameters:
_address: The address from which tokens will be burned.
_value: The number of tokens to burn.
Before burning, the function checks if the address has enough tokens (i.e., the balance is greater than or equal to the _value to be burned). If the condition is met, it reduces both the totalSupply and the balance of _address by _value.
